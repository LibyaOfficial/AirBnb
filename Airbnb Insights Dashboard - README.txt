Airbnb Insights Dashboard - README  

Overview  
This project involves creating a Tableau dashboard to analyze and visualize insights from pre-existing Airbnb data. The dashboard provides actionable information on listing performance, pricing trends and customer behavior to support data-driven decision-making for hosts and stakeholders.


Objectives  
- Visualize Key Metrics: Highlight critical insights such as average prices, Costs over time and booking trends.  
- Identify Trends: Understand seasonal pricing, demand patterns and top-performing neighborhoods.  
- Enable Comparisons: Compare listings by property type.  


Data Source  
The data was sourced from a pre-existing dataset containing information on Airbnb listings, including:  
- Property types  
- Prices and Costs
- Neighborhood locations  
- Booking trends  (Number of records)
- Guest reviews and ratings  


Tools Used  
- Tableau: For interactive data visualization and dashboard creation.  


Dashboard Features  
1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):  
   - Number of Hosts  
   - Price Per Booking  
   - Total Bookings  

2. Geographic Insights:
   - Map visualization showing listing distribution by neighborhood and price ranges.  

3. Price Trends:  
   - Time-series analysis of pricing and booking patterns.  

4. Top Listings:  
   - Identification of top-performing properties based on reviews, price or booking.  

5. Filter Options:  
   - Dynamic filters for property type, location, and date range to enable detailed analysis.  


Usage  
1. Open the Tableau Dashboard: Load file in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.  
2. Explore Filters: Adjust filters to focus on specific property types or neighborhoods.  
3. Interpret Visuals: Gain insights from the KPIs, charts and maps to understand Airbnb trends and performance.  


Potential Use Cases  
- Hosts can optimize pricing and amenities to improve occupancy and revenue.  
- Property managers can identify high-demand areas for expansion.  
- Stakeholders can use the insights to understand customer preferences and market trends.  


Next Steps  
- Integrate additional data sources (e.g., weather or event data) for enhanced analysis.  
- Automate data updates for real-time insights.  
- Expand visualizations to include customer sentiment analysis from reviews.
